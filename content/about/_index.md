<div class="about-body justified">

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Decentralized Economy program at the University of Alcal√°. My advisors are [Prof. Dr. Juan Jos√© de Lucio](https://www.uah.es/es/estudios/profesor/Juan-Jose-de-Lucio-Fernandez/) (Economics) and [Prof. Dr. Miguel √Ångel Sicilia](https://www.uah.es/es/estudios/profesor/Miguel-Angel-Sicilia-Urban/) (Blockchain & AI).

My academic research focuses on impermanent loss, a key risk in decentralized finance (DeFi) that directly affects automated market maker (AMM) liquidity providers. Impermanent loss occurs when the value of assets in a liquidity pool differs from the value of holding those same assets individually. My work aims to quantify and analyze this risk, as well as design strategies to mitigate it. My ultimate goal is to make DeFi markets more secure, transparent, and efficient for all users.

Beyond impermanent loss, I am interested in investigating the intersection of DeFi, artificial intelligence, and regulation. In short, my work encompasses theoretical, empirical, and applied research across the DeFi ecosystem. This includes risk quantification in AMMs, designing AI-based tools, and providing regulatory information that aligns innovation with financial stability.

In the fintech sector, I specialized in payment solutions and cryptocurrency processing. Notably, I led one of the first e-commerce implementations by a retailer in Latin America that successfully accepted Bitcoin payments. These pioneering projects taught me how decentralized technologies can reshape traditional finance, inspiring my ongoing work to build open, inclusive, and resilient financial infrastructures.

Outside of academia and industry, I am passionate about wine culture and produce boutique Malbecs. I also enjoy exploring nature through mountain biking and advancing financial inclusion projects that provide opportunities to underserved communities.
